# What this project adds

“A minimal hardware tag cache written in Verilog.”

# What it demonstrates

cold miss

spatial locality

conflict miss in direct-mapped cache

# Relation to the C simulator

“Mirrors address decomposition (tag/index/offset) in the C cache simulator.”

# Why this matters

“Bridges software cache simulation and hardware cache structure.”
